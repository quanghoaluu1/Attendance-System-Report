\begin{abstract}
This project presents the design and implementation of an attendance check system utilizing a Fingerprint Sensor AS608 XD-65 Module, a WiFi NodeMcu ESP8266 CH340, and an LCD 1602 display. The system leverages biometric authentication through the fingerprint sensor to accurately log attendance data. The WiFi-enabled NodeMCU ESP8266 serves as the core processing unit, managing communication between the fingerprint sensor and the LCD display while facilitating wireless data transmission to a remote server or cloud platform for storage and analysis. The LCD 1602 display provides real-time feedback to users regarding the authentication status. This project demonstrates the integration of cost-effective components to create an efficient and scalable attendance management solution suitable for educational institutions and organizations.

\section{\textbf{Introduction}}

Biometric Integration: Developing efficient methods for integrating biometric technologies, such as fingerprint recognition, into attendance management systems.\\
Cost-Effectiveness: Designing cost-effective solutions that utilize affordable components while ensuring performance and scalability.\\
Cloud-Based Solutions: Investigating cloud-based attendance management systems to leverage the benefits of remote access, scalability, and data analytics.



\section{\textbf{Main proposal}}

\subsection{System models and block diagram}
In this diagram, LCD 1602 Display, Buzzer, Red \& Green Leds will be connected to WiFi NodeMcu ESP8266. WiFi NodeMcu ESP8266 is responsible for processing the input signals from the Fingerprint sensor and managing user input through buttons or other input devices. The WiFi NodeMcu ESP8266 sends the processed signals to the display, which typically consists of a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) to display the information.
